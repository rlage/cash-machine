## The Problem

Develop a solution that simulate the delivery of notes when a client does a withdraw in a cash machine.

The basic requirements are the follow:

* Always deliver the lowest number of possible notes;

* Itâ€™s possible to get the amount requested with available notes;

* The client balance is infinite;

* Amount of notes is infinite;

* Available notes $ 100,00; $ 50,00; $ 20,00 e $ 10,00

Example:

Entry: 30.00

Result: [20.00, 10.00]

Entry: 80.00

Result: [50.00, 20.00, 10.00]

Entry: 125.00

Result: throw NoteUnavailableException

Entry: -130.00

Result: throw InvalidArgumentException

Entry: NULL

Result: [Empty Set]
